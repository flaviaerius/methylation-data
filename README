**Methylation data**
This repository contains all scripts used to analyze methylation data of ERRBS experiment for four melanoma cell lines.
It also contains the resulting processed tables from the experiments.

It also contains scripts used to analyze the data, as well as scripts and tables obtained from RNA-seq of the same cell lines.

The cell lines are:
- melan-a - non-tumorigenic melanocytes
- 4C - pre-malignant melanocytes
- 4C11- - non-metastatic melanoma cells
- 4C11+ - metastatic melanoma cells

All cell lines were extracted in three biological replicates.
